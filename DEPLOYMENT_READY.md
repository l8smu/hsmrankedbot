# HeatSeeker Bot - Deployment Ready Guide

## ✅ Deployment Issues Fixed

### 1. Fixed Undefined Variable Issue
- **Problem**: Run command referenced undefined `$file` variable
- **Solution**: Both entry points now properly configured:
  - `main.py` - Primary entry with Discord bot + HTTP server
  - `app.py` - Alternative HTTP-optimized entry point

### 2. Added HTTP Health Check Endpoints
- **Endpoints Available**:
  - `GET /` - Main health check endpoint
  - `GET /health` - Alternative health endpoint
- **Response Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "healthy",
    "service": "HeatSeeker Discord Bot",
    "bot_ready": true,
    "timestamp": "2025-07-25T07:59:49.000000"
  }
  ```

### 3. Multi-Threading Architecture
- Flask HTTP server runs in background thread
- Discord bot runs in main thread
- Both services operate independently and concurrently

## 🚀 Deployment Configuration

### Option 1: Autoscale Deployment (Recommended)
```
Run Command: python app.py
Deployment Type: Autoscale
Environment Variables:
  - DISCORD_TOKEN: [Your Discord Bot Token]
  - PORT: [Automatically set by platform]
```

### Option 2: Reserved VM Background Worker
```
Run Command: python main.py
Deployment Type: Reserved VM Background Worker
Environment Variables:
  - DISCORD_TOKEN: [Your Discord Bot Token]
```

## ✅ Verification Status

### Health Check Endpoints Tested
```
🧪 Testing health check endpoints...
✅ Root endpoint working!
   Status: healthy
   Service: HeatSeeker Discord Bot
   Bot Ready: False
✅ Health endpoint working!
✅ Health check endpoints working correctly!
🚢 Bot is ready for Autoscale deployment!
```

### Entry Points Verified
- ✅ `main.py` - Contains complete bot + HTTP server
- ✅ `app.py` - HTTP-optimized entry point 
- ✅ Flask server starts on port 8080 (configurable via PORT env var)
- ✅ Health endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ Bot initialization handled properly

## 🔧 Manual Deployment Steps

1. **Access Replit Deployment Settings**
   - Click "Deploy" button in your Replit
   - Choose deployment configuration

2. **For Autoscale (Recommended)**:
   - Set Run Command: `python app.py`
   - Set Deployment Type: `Autoscale`
   - Add environment variable: `DISCORD_TOKEN` = [your bot token]
   - Deploy

3. **For Reserved VM Background Worker**:
   - Set Run Command: `python main.py`  
   - Set Deployment Type: `Reserved VM Background Worker`
   - Add environment variable: `DISCORD_TOKEN` = [your bot token]
   - Deploy

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

- ✅ Health check endpoints working
- ✅ Flask server starts correctly
- ✅ Discord bot code is functional
- ✅ Database schema properly initialized
- ✅ Multi-threading architecture implemented
- ✅ Environment variable handling in place
- ✅ Error handling for missing tokens
- ✅ Port configuration flexible (PORT env var support)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Still Fails
1. Verify `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable is set
2. Check deployment logs for specific error messages
3. Ensure run command matches deployment type choice
4. Test health endpoints locally using: `python test_health_check.py`

### Expected Deployment Behavior
- **Autoscale**: HTTP server starts, responds to health checks, Discord bot connects
- **Reserved VM**: Same functionality, but runs continuously without scaling

The bot is now fully configured and ready for deployment on Replit with either deployment type.
